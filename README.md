You can add questions in the app and the app creates an ODF file with your questions
## Source code

The source code is not documented yet but I will comment the source code soon!

## The App

At first, you see an input box. You can input your question here and on the right side you find a button, you can click on the button and input how many bullet points you want do generate after this question.

On the left side you will find the number of the question. Click on it to delete the question input field.
### Example:

#### 1.Question
   - 
   -  
   -  

## The bottom menu
- On the bottom you will find a big blue button. Click on him and see what happen :). 
- On the left bottom side you can input in "TestName", you guess it, the test name!
- On the right bottom side you finally can submit your test. Choose the folder and the test will be generated on that place (there is no feedback if the test is successfully generated yet).
- and the fourth button is simply to reset your form!
